# Parking-Assistance-using-Arduino
The smart parking assistance project at the entry and exit points employs ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino to streamline the parking process. Ultrasonic sensors are positioned strategically at the entry and exit lanes to detect the presence of vehicles. As a vehicle approaches, these sensors emit ultrasonic waves, which bounce off the vehicle and are received back by the sensor. The Arduino, acting as the central processing unit, interprets the data received from the ultrasonic sensors to determine if a parking space is available or if the vehicle is exiting. Once this information is processed, the Arduino communicates with an I2C display module to provide real-time updates on parking availability and guide incoming and outgoing vehicles to vacant spots or exit lanes respectively. This display module visually represents the availability of parking spaces, making it easy for drivers to locate empty spots without circling around. By efficiently managing parking entry and exit, the system reduces congestion and optimizes space utilization in the college parking area, thereby enhancing the overall parking experience for students, staff, and visitors.
